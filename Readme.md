# Optimization Methods Visualization

An interactive visualization tool for comparing Newton's Method and Gradient Descent optimization algorithms.

## Overview

This program provides a visual demonstration of how Newton's Method and Gradient Descent work to find the minimum of the quadratic function f(x) = xÂ² - 4x + 4. Users can:

- Switch between optimization methods
- Adjust starting points
- Control number of iterations 
- Step through the optimization process
- Watch animated convergence

## Features

- Real-time visualization of optimization steps
- Interactive controls for parameters
- Side-by-side comparison of methods
- Helpful guide panel
- Formula display for each step
- Current position and value tracking

## Requirements
